</div>

### Description

This is almost like my Remote Proxy Daemon Programs except that this type of Proxy Daemon, apon connection to it, itll automaticly connect you to the specifyed Remote address and port Set By the Administrator running the program.

Maybe Useful as a simple fast routing system for SMTP, POP, NNTP, IMAP, and HTTP protocols. Great Code for people not to familar with Winsock Programming. At the very least, itll teach ya howta do a simple connection to a remote machine or act as a server machine and listen for incoming calls.
